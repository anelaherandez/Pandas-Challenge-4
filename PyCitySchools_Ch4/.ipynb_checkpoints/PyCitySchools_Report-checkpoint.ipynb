    "# Analysis \n",
    "   In an effort to better understand the outcome of standardized testing throughout this area, data scientists conducted analysis on the math and reading scores for each student from 15 schools (7 district schools and 8 charter schools). A variety of computations were performed to gain insight into what factors impact the overall passing of the standardized tests to improve passing rates in the future. This analysis highlighted the success seen in both math and reading testing at charter schools, as well as showed the areas of concern, particularly with regards to district schools and the overall passing rate for schools with a student population larger than 2000. \n",
    "The top five performing schools are all charter schools with student populations less than 2500 students and on average spent 620 dollars per student on test preparation. Additionally, these schools had an average 90% overall passing rate. Conversely, the bottom five schools were all district schools with student populations greater than 2500 individuals. Although these bottom schools showed a relatively solid reading passing percentage, all five schools had a less than 70% pass rate for the math test and overall failed the complete standardized test with an average passing rate of 53%. This analysis brought into question whether spending per student could potentially impact these passing outcomes, however the data does not strongly support one way or another the success of a school. The spending analysis shows that the largest category spent per student ($645-$680) had the lowest overall passing percentage (53.52% passing). The data suggests that school size is a significant factor in the success of students on passing the standardized tests. The largest category of school type (population of 2000-5000 students) showed that students only 69% of students passed the math portion of the tests and overall, only 58% passed the entire test. The schools with less than 2000 students have a much higher passing percentage in math and reading as well as overall. \n",
    "The conclusions drawn from this analysis point to a need to focus more attention to student preparation on the math portion of the test in larger district schools. For all 15 schools the reading portion of the test saw positive passing percentages (only one school had lower than 80% passing in reading), while the math scores and passing rates were quite a bit lower. The charter schools do not suffer from the same low math scores, which correlate to school size, however this attribute was not analyzed further. To better understand how these district schools can improve their math scores further analysis on classroom size, student attributes, and a more intensive look at the difference between charter and district school frameworks needs to be conducted. \n",
